        What is Lorem Ipsum?
Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting 
industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text 
ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of 
type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived 
not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, 
remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s 
with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker 
including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
<p class="conteudo">Why do we use it?
It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the 
readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of 
using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution 
of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making 
it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and 
web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, 
and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in 
their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes 
by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
<p class="conteudo">Where does it come from?
Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply 
random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin 
literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard 
McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, 
looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a 
Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in 
classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum 
comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et 
Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. 
This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during 
the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit 
amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced 
below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus 
Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact 
original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation 
by H. Rackham.</p>
